DESCRIPTION:
------------

This is a binary version of Doug MacEachern's mod_perl, built for Win32.
This binary is concurrent with version 1.15 of mod_perl.

Mod_perl is an extremely useful module for the Apache HTTP server.  It
allows you to: achieve a significant speed increase over CGI, configure
your web server entirely in Perl, use Perl to intervene in any stage of an
HTTP request, etc.

This from the mod_perl README:

  "The Apache/Perl integration project brings together the full power of
  the Perl programming language and the Apache HTTP server.  This is
  achieved by linking the Perl runtime library into the server and
  providing an object oriented Perl interface to the server's C language
  API. 
  "These pieces are seamlessly glued together by the `mod_perl' server
  plugin, making it is possible to write Apache modules entirely in
  Perl.  In addition, the persistent interpreter embedded in the server
  avoids the overhead of starting an external interpreter program and
  the additional Perl start-up (compile) time."

PREREQUISITES:

To use this binary of mod_perl, you need at least the following software:

Windows NT 4.0 sp3
Apache 1.3.1 (http://www.apache.org/dist)
Perl 5.004_04 (http://www.perl.com/CPAN/src/latest.tar.gz)

...and an Intel processor.

This binary was built using Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0 on Windows NT 4.0
(Build 1381) Sevice Pack 3.  It has been tested on this platform only, and

INSTALLATION:
-------------

This archive includes both the binary mod_perl library and the required perl
side of mod_perl.  To install, extract this archive to a temporary location 
and copy the perl\lib\ tree to your Perl top level directory (e.g. c:\perl).  

**BE CAREFUL NOT TO CLOBBER YOUR PERL LIB TREE!**

Then, simply move apache\modules\ApacheModulePerl.dll to the modules directory under your 
apache tree (e.g. c:\apache\modules\)

To use mod_perl, you will need to add the following line to your
httpd.conf:

LoadModule perl_module modules/ApacheModulePerl

Please consult README for more info.

CAVEATS AND KNOWN PROBLEMS:
---------------------------

For some reason, rand() is completely broken on mod_perl under Win32.  
Don't use it unless you want the same number everytime.

Apache 1.3.1 still won't start as a service.  Although, you can use
srvany.exe to beat it into submission.
